1. Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation files for the Market Mood & Moves project. The code corresponds to the theoretical framework explained in the end-term report and demonstrates how sentiment extracted 
from financial text is integrated with historical stock market data to model and analyze price movements.

The purpose of this codebase is to implement the complete end-to-end pipeline, including data collection, sentiment extraction, time-series modeling, and evaluation. All theoretical explanations, derivations, 
and conceptual discussions are documented in the accompanying report. This repository focuses exclusively on implementation.

2. Project Structure

The codebase is organized in a modular manner to reflect the logical stages of the project:

Data Collection and Preprocessing

Scripts and notebooks for collecting financial news and historical stock price data

Data cleaning, alignment, and preprocessing utilities

Sentiment Analysis Module

Implementation of sentiment extraction using a pre-trained FinBERT model

Conversion of unstructured financial text into numerical sentiment scores

Feature Engineering

Construction of time-series features from price data

Aggregation and alignment of sentiment scores with market data

Time-Series Modeling

Implementation of sequence models for learning temporal dependencies

Integration of sentiment and numerical features as multimodal inputs

Training and Evaluation

Model training routines

Performance evaluation and result visualization

Each component is designed to be independent yet compatible, allowing the entire pipeline to be executed sequentially.

3. Integration of Project Components

The project follows a pipeline-based architecture, where outputs from one stage serve as inputs to the next:

Financial news and stock price data are collected and preprocessed

Sentiment scores are extracted from news articles using FinBERT

Sentiment data is temporally aligned with historical price data

Combined features are fed into a time-series prediction model

Model outputs are evaluated using appropriate metrics

This structure reflects the integration of concepts from behavioral finance, natural language processing, and sequential modeling, as discussed in the end-term report.

4. Execution Guidelines

The code files are intended to be run in the same order as the pipeline stages.

Jupyter Notebooks are used where step-by-step execution and visualization are required.

Python scripts are used for modular processing and reusability.

All necessary library imports are included within the respective files.

No changes to the code are required for evaluation, provided the environment dependencies are satisfied.

5. Dependencies and Environment

The project is implemented in Python and makes use of standard data science and machine learning libraries, including:

Numerical and data handling libraries

Natural Language Processing libraries

Deep learning frameworks for sequence modeling

Exact library versions and installation details are provided within the code files or notebooks where required.

6. Notes for Evaluation

The theoretical explanation of all methods, models, and formulas is provided in the end-term report.

This repository serves as the practical implementation of those concepts.

The code is structured for clarity and modularity rather than optimization for deployment.

Outputs and visualizations generated by the code are intended to support understanding and evaluation of model behavior.

7. Conclusion

This code repository completes the Market Mood & Moves project by translating theoretical concepts into a working implementation. Together with the end-term report, it demonstrates a complete understanding of 
sentiment-driven financial modeling, from data collection to evaluation.
